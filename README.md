# Prairie Code 2019 - Working with PDFs in Python

This repository is for a talk I am giving at [Prairie Code 2019](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/).

To use the code in this repo, you will need to do the following:

`pip install reportlab pypdf2`

I have covered ReportLab in detail in my book, [ReportLab: PDF Processing with Python](https://leanpub.com/reportlab/). This book also covers PyPDF2, pdfrw and several other PDF related libraries for Python:

If you'd like to use the included wxPython GUI application, you will need to also install wxPython 4:

`pip install wxpython`

Linux users should see the [wxPython website](https://wxpython.org/) for installation issues should any arise.

The code for the PDF GUI Utility is from my book, [Creating Applications with wxPython](https://leanpub.com/creatingapplicationswithwxpython/).

You can also read about the utility on my blog in the article, [wxPython â€“ Creating a PDF Merger / Splitter Utility](https://www.blog.pythonlibrary.org/2019/09/10/wxpython-creating-a-pdf-merger-splitter-utility/)
