# Prairie Code 2019 - Working with PDFs in Python

This repository is for a talk I am giving at [Prairie Code 2019](https://prairiecode.amegala.com/).

To use the code in this repo, you will need to do the following:

`pip install reportlab pypdf2`

If you'd like to use the included wxPython GUI application, you will need to also install wxPython 4:

`pip install reportlab wxpython`

Linux users should see the [wxPython website](https://wxpython.org/) for installation issues should any arise.

The code for the PDF GUI Utility is from my book, [Creating Applications with wxPython](https://leanpub.com/creatingapplicationswithwxpython/).
